<!-- ============================================ 
        This Stitch is used for content heavy interior pages
        that have no design or layout.  Often times these are 
        content silos where you talk extensively about a topic
        to educate your visitors and rank on Google for the 
        content.  These are great for pages that have a TON
        of content.  Design isn't important here, it's all 
        about making the content accessible and easy to read.

      <h2 class="cs-title">Why I Focus on Small Business</h2>
      <p>
        I grew up in a family of small business owners – from contractors and
        architects to market owners. I saw firsthand how the right tools can
        make a small business punch above its weight. Today, I help businesses
        like yours deliver an exceptional customer experience without breaking
        the bank.
      </p>

      <h2 class="cs-title">How I Work</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Results, not complexity</strong> - You get solutions built for
          your business goals, not unnecessary features you'll never use.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Smart solutions, reasonable budgets</strong> - Creative
          problem-solving that makes your budget work harder.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Clear communication</strong> - You'll always know exactly what
          you're getting and how it will bring you more business.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="cs-title">Who I Work With</h2>
      <p>
        I partner with small businesses across the US and globally, with a home
        base in Boulder where I can meet clients face-to-face. My clients range
        from law firms and preschools to engineering firms and therapists –
        ambitious businesses that want to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Compete with larger companies</li>
        <li>Create exceptional customer experiences</li>
        <li>Get more clients without drowning in tech</li>
        <li>Focus on their work, not website hassles</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="cs-title">What Makes Us Different</h2>
      <p>
        Big agencies might have fancy offices, but they also come with big
        overhead and endless meetings. Working with me, you get:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Direct access to someone who understands small business (I come from a
          family of entrepreneurs)
        </li>
        <li>Creative solutions that maximize your budget</li>
        <li>A no-BS approach focused on getting you results</li>
        <li>The personal attention big agencies can't provide</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="cs-title">My Approach</h2>
      <p>
        I believe small businesses deserve big results. While I work with
        companies of all sizes, I'm particularly drawn to helping small
        businesses because:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You get straight to the point – no corporate red tape</li>
        <li>Your success directly impacts real people and communities</li>
        <li>You need creative solutions that make every dollar count</li>
        <li>You're genuinely passionate about serving your customers</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Whether you're down the street in Boulder or across the globe, I bring
        the same commitment to helping you win more business efficiently.
